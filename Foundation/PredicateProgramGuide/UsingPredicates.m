#pragma mark -- Evaluating Predicates
    
    /**
     To evaluate a predicate, you use the NSPredicate method
     evaluateWithObject: and pass in the object against which
     the predicate will be evaluated. The method returns a Boolean
     value -- in the following example, the result is YES.
     
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:
     @"SELF IN %@", @[@"Stig", @"Shaffiq", @"Chris"]];
     BOOL result = [predicate evaluateWithObject:@"Shaffiq"];
     
     You can use predicates with any class of object, but the class
     must support key-value coding for the keys you want to
     use in a predicate.
     */
    
#pragma mark -- Using Predicates With Arrays
    
    /**
     NSArray and NSMutableArray provide methods to filter array
     contents. NSArray provides filteredArrayUsingPredicate:
     which returns a new array containing objects in the receiver
     that match the specified predicate. NSMutableArray provides
     filterUsingPredicate: which evaluates the receiver's content
     against the specified predicate. NSMutableArray provides
     filterUsingPredicate: which evaluates the receiver's content
     against the specified predicate and leaves only objects
     that match.
     ============================================================
     NSMutableArray *names = [@[@"Nick", @"Ben", @"Adam", @"Melissa"]
     mutableCopy];
      
     NSPredicate *bPredicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:
     @"SELF beginswith[c] 'b'"];
     NSArray *beginWithB = [names filteredArrayUsingPredicate:bPredicate];
     // beginWithB contains { @"Ben" }.

     @"SELF contains[c] 'e'"];
     [names filterUsingPredicate:ePredicate];
     // array now contains { @"Ben", @"Melissa" }
     ============================================================
     
     If you use the Core Data framework, the array methods provide
     an efficient means of filtering an existing array of objects
     without -- as a fetch does -- requiring a round trip to persistent
     data store.

#pragma mark -- Using Predicates with Key-Paths
    
    /*
     Recall that you can follow relationships in a predicate using a
     key path. The following example illustrates the creation of
     a predicate to find employees that belong to a department with
     a given name(but see also Performance).
     ============================================================
     NSString *departmentName = ... ;
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:
             @"department.name like %@", departmentName];
     ============================================================
     
     If you use a to-many relationship, the construction of a predicate
     is slightly different. If you want to fetch Departments in which
     at least one of the employees has the first name "Matthew", for
     instance, you use an ANY operator as shown in the following
     example:
     ============================================================
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:
     @"ANY employees.firstName like 'Matthew'"];
     ============================================================
     
     If you want to find Departments in which at least one of the
     employees is paid more than a certain amount, you use an
     ANY operator as shown in the following example:
     ============================================================
     float salary = ... ;
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:
     @"ANY employees.salary > %f", salary];
     ============================================================

#pragma mark -- Using NULL Values
    
    /**
     A comparison predicate does not match any value with null except
     null(nil) or the NSNULL null value(this is, ($value == nil) returns
     YES if $value is nil). Consider the following example.
     ============================================================
     NSString *firstName = @"Ben";
      
     NSArray *array = @[ @{ @"lastName" : "Turner" }];
                         @{ @"firstName" : @"Ben", @"lastName" : @"Ballard",
                            @"birthday", [NSDate dateWithString:@"1972-03-24
                            10:45:32 +0600"] } ];

     NSArray *filteredArray = [array filteredArrayUsingPredicate:predicate];
      
     NSLog(@"filteredArray: %@", filteredArray);
     // Output:
     // filteredArray ({birthday = 1972-03-24 10:45:32 +0600; \\
                           firstName = Ben; lastName = Ballard;})
     ============================================================
     
     The predicate does match the dictionary that contains a value
     Ben for the key firstName, but does not match the dictionary
     with no value for the key firstName. The following code fragment
     illustrates the same point using a date and a greater-than comparator.
     ============================================================
     NSDate *referenceDate = [NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSince1970:0];
      
     predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"birthday > %@", referenceDate];
     filteredArray = [array filteredArrayUsingPredicate:predicate];
      
     NSLog(@"filteredArray: %@", filteredArray);
     // Output:
     // filteredArray: ({birthday = 1972-03-24 10:45:32 +0600; \\
                            firstName = Ben; lastName = Ballard;})
     ============================================================
     */
    
    /**
     Testing for Null
     
     If you want to match null values, you must include a specific
     test in addition to other comparisons, as illustrated in the
     following fragment.
     ============================================================
     predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"(firstName == %@)
     || (firstName = nil)", firstName];
     filteredArray = [array filteredArrayUsingPredicate:predicate];

     1972-03-23 20:45:32 -0800; firstName = Ben; lastName = Ballard; }
     ============================================================

     By implication, a test for null that matches a null value
     returns true. In the following code fragment, ok is set to
     YES for both predicate evaluations.
     ============================================================
     predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"firstName = nil"];
     BOOL ok = [predicate evaluateWithObject:[NSDictionary dictionary]];
      
     ok = [predicate evaluateWithObject:
         [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:[NSNull null] forKey:@"firstName"]];

#pragma mark -- Using Predicates with Core Data
    
    /*
     If you are using the Core Data framework, you can use predicates
     in the same way as you would if you were not using Core Data (for
     example, to filter arrays or with an array controller). In addition,
     however, you can also use predicates as constraints on a fetch request
     and you can store fetch request templates in the managed object model
     (see Managed Object Models).
     ============================================================
     Limitations: You cannot necessarily translate “arbitrary” SQL
     queries into predicates or fetch requests. There is no way,
     for example, to convert a SQL statement such as

     SELECT t1.name, V1, V2
         FROM table1 t1 JOIN (SELECT t2.name AS V1, count(*) AS V2
             FROM table2 t2 GROUP BY t2.name as V) on t1.name = V.V1
     
     into a fetch request. You must fetch the objects of interest,
     then either perform a calculation directly using the results,
     or use an array operator.
     ============================================================
     */
    
    /**
     Fetch Requests
     
     You create a predicate to match properties of the target
     entity (note that you can follow relationships using key paths)
     and associate the predicate with a fetch request. When
     the request is executed, an array is returned that
     contains the objects (if any) that match the criteria
     specified by the predicate. The following example illustrates
     the use of a predicate to find employees that earn more
     than a specified amount.
     ============================================================
     NSFetchRequest *request = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];
     NSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@"Employee"
             inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext];

    /**
     Object Controllers

     If you are using Cocoa bindings, you can specify a fetch
     predicate for an object controller (such as an instance
     of NSObjectController or NSArrayController). You can type
     a predicate directly into the predicate editor text field
     in the Attributes Inspector in Xcode or you can set it
     programmatically using setFetchPredicate:. The predicate
     is used to constrain the results returned when the
     controller executes a fetch. If you are using an
     NSObjectController object, you specify a fetch that
     uniquely identifies the object you want to be the
     controller's content—for example, if the controller’s
     entity is Department, the predicate might be name
     like "Engineering".

#pragma mark -- Using Regular Expressions

    /*
     The MATCHES operator uses ICU's Regular Expressions package,
     as illustrated in the following example:
     ============================================================
     NSArray *array = @[@"TATACCATGGGCCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCACAG",
                        @"CGGGATCCCTATCAAGGCACCTCTTCG", @"CATGCCATGGATACCAACGAGTCCGAAC",
                        @"CAT", @"CATCATCATGTCT", @"DOG"];
      
     // find strings that contain a repetition of at least 3 'CAT' sequences,
     // but not followed by a further 'CA'
     NSPredicate *catPredicate =
         [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"SELF MATCHES '.*(CAT){3,}(?!CA).*'"];
      
     NSArray *filteredArray = [array filteredArrayUsingPredicate:catPredicate];
     // filteredArray contains just 'CATCATCATGTCT'
     ============================================================

     According to the ICU specification, regular expression
     metacharacters are not valid inside a pattern set. For
     example, the regular expression \d{9}[\dxX] does not match
     valid ISBN numbers (any ten digit number, or a string
     with nine digits and the letter 'X') since the pattern
     set ([\dxX]) contains a metacharacter (\d). Instead you
     could write an OR expression, as shown in the following
     code sample:
     ============================================================
     NSArray *isbnTestArray = @[@"123456789X", @"987654321x",
     @"1234567890", @"12345X", @"1234567890X"];
     NSPredicate *isbnPredicate =
         [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"SELF MATCHES '\\\\d{10}|\\\\d{9}[Xx]'"];
      
     NSArray *isbnArray = [isbnTestArray filteredArrayUsingPredicate:isbnPredicate];
     // isbnArray contains (123456789X, 987654321x, 1234567890)
     ============================================================
     */
    
#pragma mark -- Performance Considerations

    /**
     You should structure compound predicates to minimize
     the amount of work done. Regular expression matching
     in particular is an expensive operation. In a compound
     predicate, you should therefore perform simple tests
     before a regular expression; thus instead of using a
     predicate shown in the following example:
     ============================================================
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:
     @"( title matches .*mar[1-10] ) OR ( type = 1 )"];
     ============================================================
     
     you should write
     ============================================================
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:
     @"( type = 1 ) OR ( title matches .*mar[1-10] )"];
     ============================================================

     In the second example, the regular expression is evaluated
     only if the first clause is false.
     */
    
    /**
     Using Joins
     
     In general, joins (queries that cross relationships) are
     also expensive operations, and you should avoid them if
     you can. When testing to-one relationships, if you already
     have—or can easily retrieve—the relationship source object
     (or its object ID), it is more efficient to test for
     object equality than to test for a property of the
     source object. Instead of writing the following:
     ============================================================
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:
     @"department.name like %@", [department name]];
     ============================================================
     
     it is more efficient to write:
     ============================================================
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:
     @"department == %@", department];
     ============================================================

     If a predicate contains more than one expression, it is
     also typically more efficient to structure it to avoid
     joins. For example, @"firstName beginswith[cd] 'Matt'
     AND (ANY directreports.paygrade <= 7)" is likely to be
     more efficient than @"(ANY directreports.paygrade <= 7)
     AND (firstName beginswith[cd] 'Matt')" because the former
     avoids making a join unless the first test succeeds.
     */

    /**
     Structuring Your Data

     In some situations, there may be tension between
     the representation of your data and the use of predicates.
     If you intend to use predicates in your application,
     the pattern of typical query operations may influence
     how you structure your data. In Core Data, although
     you specify entities and entity-class mapping, the
     levels that create the underlying structures in the
     persistent store are opaque. Nevertheless, you still
     have control over your entities and the properties
     they have.

     In addition to tending to be expensive, joins may
     also restrict flexibility. It may be appropriate,
     therefore, to de-normalize your data. In general—assuming
     that queries are issued often—it may be a good
     trade-off to have larger objects, but for it to be
     easier to find the right ones (and so have fewer in
     memory).

#pragma mark -- Using Predicates with Cocoa Bindings

    /**
     In OS X, you can set a predicate for an array
     controller to filter the content array. You can

     You can also bind the array controller’s filterPredicate
     binding to a method that returns an NSPredicate object.
     The object that implements the method may be the File's
     Owner or another controller object. If you change the
     predicate, remember that you must do so in a key-value
     observing compliant way (see Key-Value Observing
     Programming Guide) so that the array controller
     updates itself accordingly.

     You can also bind the predicate binding of an
     NSSearchField object to the filterPredicate of
