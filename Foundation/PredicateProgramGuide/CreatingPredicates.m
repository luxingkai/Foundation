#pragma mark -- Creating a Predicate Using a Format String

    /**
     
     You can use NSPredicate class methods of the form predicateWithFormat...
     to create a predicate directly from a string. You define the
     predicate as a string, optionally using variable substitution.
     At runtime, variable substitution -- if any -- is performed, and
     the resulting string is parsed to create corresponding predicate
     and expression objects. The following example creates a compound
     predicate with two comparison predicates.
     ============================================================
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate
     predicateWithFormat:@"(lastName like[cd] %@) AND (birthday > %@)",
             lastNameSearchString, birthdaySearchDate];
     ============================================================
     (In the example, like[cd] is a modified "like" operator that is
     case-insensitive and diacritic-insensitive.) For a complete
     description of the string syntax and a list of all the operators
     available.
     
     ⚠️ The predicate format string syntax is different from the regular
     expression syntax. The regular expression syntax is defined by the
     ICU - http://www.icu-project.org/userguide/regexp.html
     
     The predicate string parser is whitespace insensitive, case insensitive
     with respect to keywords, and supports nested parenthetical expressions.
     It also supports printf-style format specifiers (like %x and %@).
     Variables are denoted with a $(for example $VARIABLE_NAME).
     
     The parser does not perform any semantic type checking. It makes
     a best-guess effort to create suitable expressions, but - particularly
     in the case of substitution variables - it is possible that a
     runtime error will be generated.
     
     This approach is typically best used for predefined query terms,
     although variable substitution allows for considerable flexibility.
     The disadvantage of this technique is that you must take care
     to avoid introducing errors into the string - you will not
     discover mistakes until runtime.
     */
    
    /**
     String Constants, Variables, and Wildcards
     
     String constants must be quoted within the expression -- single
     and double quotes are both acceptable, but must be paired
     appropriately (that is, a double quote(") does not match a single
     quote(')). If you use variable substitution using %@ (such as
     firstName like %@), the quotation marks are added for you
     automatically. If you use string constants within your format
     string, you must quote them yourself, as in the following
     example.
     ============================================================
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate
     predicateWithFormat:@"lastName like[c] \"S*\""];
     ============================================================

     You must take automatic quotation into account when using
     wildcards -- you must add wildcards to a variable prior to
     substitution, as shown in the following example.
     ============================================================
     NSString *prefix = @"prefix";
     NSString *suffix = @"suffix";
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate
         predicateWithFormat:@"SELF like[c] %@",
         [[prefix stringByAppendingString:@"*"] stringByAppendingString:suffix]];
     BOOL ok = [predicate evaluateWithObject:@"prefixxxxxxsuffix"];
     ============================================================

     In this example, variable subtitution produces the predicate
     string SELF LIKE[c] "prefix*suffix", and the value of ok is YES.
     The following fragmen, by contrast, yields the predicate string
     SELF LIKE[c] "prefix" * "suffix", and the predicate evaluation
     yields a runtime error:
     ============================================================
     predicate = [NSPredicate
         predicateWithFormat:@"SELF like[c] %@*%@", prefix, suffix];
     ok = [predicate evaluateWithObject:@"prefixxxxxxsuffix"];
     ============================================================
     
     Finally, the following fragment results in a runtime parse error
     (Unable to parse the format string "SELF like[c] %@*").
     ============================================================
     predicate = [NSPredicate
     predicateWithFormat:@"SELF like[c] %@*", prefix];
     ============================================================
     
     You should also note the difference between variable substitution
     in the format string and variable expressions. The following
     code fragment creates a predicate with a right-hand side that
     is a variable expression.
     ============================================================
     predicate = [NSPredicate
     predicateWithFormat:@"lastName like[c] $LAST_NAME"];
     ============================================================
     */

    /**
     Boolean Values
     
     You specify and test for equality of Boolean values as illustrated
     in the following examples:
     ============================================================
     NSPredicate *newPredicate =
         [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"anAttribute == %@", [NSNumber numberWithBool:aBool]];
     NSPredicate *testForTrue =
         [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"anAttribute == YES"];
     */
    
    /**
     Dynamic Property Names
     
     Because string variables are surrounded by quotation marks when
     they are substituted into a format string using %@, you cannot
     use %@ to specify a dynamic property name -- as illustrated in
     the following example.
     ============================================================
     NSString *attributeName = @"firstName";
     NSString *attributeValue = @"Adam";
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"%@ like %@",
             attributeName, attributeValue];
     ============================================================

     The predicate format string in this case evaluates to "firstName"
     like "Adam".
     If you want to specify a dynamic property name, you use %K in the
     format string, as shown in the following fragment.
     ============================================================
     predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"%K like %@",
     attributeName, attributeValue];
     ============================================================

     The predicate format string in this case evaluates to firstName
     like "Adam" (note that there are no quotation marks around
     firstName).
     */
    
#pragma mark -- Creating Predicates Directly in Code
    
    /**
     You can create predicate and expression instances directly
     in code. NSComparisonPredicate and NSCompoundPredicate
     provide convenience methods that allow you to easily create
     compound and comparison predicates respectively.
     NSComparisonPredicate provides a number of operators ranging
     from simple equality tests to custom functions.
     
     The following example shows how to create a predicate to
     represent (revenue >= 10000) and (revenue < 10000000).
     Note that the same left-hand side expression is used for
     both comparison predicates.
     ============================================================
     NSExpression *lhs = [NSExpression expressionForKeyPath:@"revenue"];
      
     NSExpression *greaterThanRhs = [NSExpression expressionForConstantValue:[NSNumber numberWithInt:1000000]];
     NSPredicate *greaterThanPredicate = [NSComparisonPredicate
         predicateWithLeftExpression:lhs
         rightExpression:greaterThanRhs
         modifier:NSDirectPredicateModifier
         type:NSGreaterThanOrEqualToPredicateOperatorType
         options:0];
      
     NSExpression *lessThanRhs = [NSExpression expressionForConstantValue:[NSNumber numberWithInt:100000000]];
     NSPredicate *lessThanPredicate = [NSComparisonPredicate
         predicateWithLeftExpression:lhs
         rightExpression:lessThanRhs
         modifier:NSDirectPredicateModifier
         type:NSLessThanPredicateOperatorType
         options:0];
      
     NSCompoundPredicate *predicate = [NSCompoundPredicate andPredicateWithSubpredicates:
         @[greaterThanPredicate, lessThanPredicate]];
     ============================================================
     
     The disadvantage of this technique should be immediately apparent--
     you may have to write a lot of code. The advantages are that it
     is less prone to spelling and other typographical errors that
     may only be discovered at runtime and it may be fasteer than
     depending on string parsing.
     
     This technique is most likely to be useful when the creation of
     the predicate is itself dynamic, such as in a predicate builder.

#pragma mark -- Creating Predicates Using Predicate Templates

    /**
     Predicate templates offer a good compromise between the
     easy-to-use but potentailly error-prone format string-based
     technique and the code-intensive pure coding approach.
     A predicate template is simply a predicate that includes
     a variable expression. (If you are using the Core Data
     framework, you can use the Xcode design tools to add
     predicate templates for fetch requests to your model—see
     Managed Object Models.) The following example uses a
     format string to create a predicate with a right-hand
     side that is a variable expression.
     ============================================================
     NSPredicate *predicateTemplate = [NSPredicate
     predicateWithFormat:@"lastName like[c] $LAST_NAME"];
     ============================================================

     This is equivalent to creating the variable expression
     directly as shown in the following example.
     ============================================================
     NSExpression *lhs = [NSExpression expressionForKeyPath:@"lastName"];
      
     NSExpression *rhs = [NSExpression expressionForVariable:@"LAST_NAME"];
      
     NSPredicate *predicateTemplate = [NSComparisonPredicate
         predicateWithLeftExpression:lhs
         rightExpression:rhs
         modifier:NSDirectPredicateModifier
         type:NSLikePredicateOperatorType
         options:NSCaseInsensitivePredicateOption];
     ============================================================

     To create a valid predicate to evaluate against an
     object, you use the NSPredicate method
     predicateWithSubstitutionVariables: to pass in a
     dictionary that contains the variables to be substituted.
     (Note that the dictionary must contain key-value pairs for
     all the variables specified in the predicate.)
     ============================================================
     NSPredicate *predicate = [predicateTemplate predicateWithSubstitutionVariables:
     [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"Turner" forKey:@"LAST_NAME"]];
     ============================================================

     The new predicate returned by this example is lastName
     LIKE[c] "Turner".

     Because the substitution dictionary must contain key-value
     pairs for all the variables specified in the predicate,
     if you want to match a null value, you must provide a
     null value in the dictionary, as illustrated in the
     following example.
     ============================================================
     NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate
         predicateWithFormat:@"date = $DATE"];
     predicate = [predicate predicateWithSubstitutionVariables:
         [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:[NSNull null] forKey:@"DATE"]];
     ============================================================
     
     The predicate formed by this example is date == <null>.
     */
    
    
#pragma mark -- Format String Summary
    
    /**
     It is important to distinguish between the different
     types of value in a format string. Note also that
     single or double quoting variables (or substitution
     variable strings) will cause %@, %K, or $variable to
     be interpreted as a literal in the format string and
     so will prevent any substitution.
     
     @"attributeName == %@"
     This predicate checks whether the value of the key
     attributeName is the same as the value of the object
     %@ that is supplied at runtime as an argument to
     predicateWithFormat:. Note that %@ can be a placeholder
     for any object whose description is valid in the
     predicate, such as an instance of NSDate, NSNumber,
     NSDecimalNumber, or NSString.

     @"%K == %@"
     This predicate checks whether the value of the key %K
     is the same as the value of the object %@. The variables
     are supplied at runtime as arguments to predicateWithFormat:.

     @"name IN $NAME_LIST"
     This is a template for a predicate that checks whether
     the value of the key name is in the variable $NAME_LIST
     (no quotes) that is supplied at runtime using
     predicateWithSubstitutionVariables:.

     @"'name' IN $NAME_LIST"
     This is a template for a predicate that checks
     whether the constant value 'name' (note the quotes
     around the string) is in the variable $NAME_LIST
     that is supplied at runtime using
     predicateWithSubstitutionVariables:.

     @"$name IN $NAME_LIST"
     This is a template for a predicate that expects
     values to be substituted (using
     predicateWithSubstitutionVariables:) for both
     $NAME and $NAME_LIST.

     @"%K == '%@'"
     This predicate checks whether the value of the
     key %K is equal to the string literal “%@“
     (note the single quotes around %@). The key name
     %K is supplied at runtime as an argument to
     predicateWithFormat:.
